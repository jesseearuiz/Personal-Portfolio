              Hello! I'm Jessee Ruiz, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about my
              journey into the world of programming. Eager to learn and
              passionate about technology, I've embarked on a full-stack
              software engineering path. From crafting sleek user interfaces to
              building robust backend systems, I'm on a mission to master the
              art and science of coding. As I navigate this exciting landscape,
              I'm driven by a curiosity to create innovative solutions that make
              a tangible difference.
