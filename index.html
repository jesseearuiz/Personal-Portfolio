              Hello! I'm Jessee Ruiz, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about my
              journey into the world of programming. Eager to learn and
              passionate about technology, I've embarked on a full-stack
              software engineering path. From crafting sleek user interfaces to
              building robust backend systems, I'm on a mission to master the
              art and science of coding. As I navigate this exciting landscape,
              I'm driven by a curiosity to create innovative solutions that make
              a tangible difference.

          <p class="project-par">
            I took an active role in the development of our team by creating and modifying a team training curriculum, complete with tailored exercises. This approach ensured that our training regimen aligned closely with the group's interests and needs, maximizing player growth and development. I also assessed player performance, skill levels, and character traits, allowing me to gain a comprehensive understanding of their individual needs. When applicable, I recommended talented players to higher-level soccer academies, nurturing their potential for broader opportunities. Cultivating respect and trust among approximately 20 players was a key priority for me. To achieve this, I engaged with their specific interests and designed exercises that catered to their preferences. This approach not only improved their attention and engagement during training but also fostered a strong sense of camaraderie within the team. Furthermore, I recognized the importance of building a community and fostering transparency with the players' parents. I developed personal relationships with them, which not only contributed to a sense of trust and unity but also resulted in the creation of my own personal training summer camp, strengthening the bonds between players, parents, and the team as a whole.
